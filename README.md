# GitHub Profile

I took on a challenge from devChallenges to create a SPA that utilizes the GitHub API to fetch and display information about repositories and users.

This project was developed using JavaScript and React, ensuring a dynamic and interactive user experience.
Additionally, I implemented responsive design to make the app accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
